-- Station Id above will be surveyed beginning on March 8, 2023
-- DO THIS TASK FIRST BEFORE ADDDING ACTUAL STATION INTO NewRetail.dbo.tblSvAddress
INSERT tblLuSv (LuSvSurveyorId, LuSvStationId, LuSvSurveyCode, LuSvSurveyZone)
SELECT '9998','71014573','H2',1

-- 2nd task is link the station id to a surveyor id. 9998 is LSI, meaning no assigned surveyor to the survey.

-- That's it! You are done. To test. Do data entry
